## Stock-recruitment functions

Stock-recruitment functions describe the production of new recruits to a fish population and the dependence of that production on the spawning component of the population.

## Beverton-Holt

## Ricker

## What is steepness?

"the fraction of recruitment from a virgin population obtained when the spawner are at 20% of the virgin level"



## Equilibrium recruitment

## Definitions

-   $R_0$: virgin, unfished recruitment

-   $\Phi_0$: virgin, unfished spawning biomass per recruit

-   $S_{0}$: virgin unfished spawning biomass

-   $\Phi_F$ biomass per recruit at $F \neq 0$

-   $YPR_F$: yield per recruit at $F \neq 0$

-   $CR$: compensation ratio

-   $h$: steepness

-   $SRR$: stock-recruitment relationship

## YPR quantities at various fishing mortalities

Find $SBPR$ and $YPR$ at the $F$ value of interest and calculate these values when $F = 0$. This will vary depending on your model:

$$
Y P R=\Sigma_{a} F s_{a} N_{a} w_{a}
$$

-   $N_a$ is a proportional expected numbers-at-age

-   $w_a$ is the expected weight-at-age

-   $s_a$ is fishery selectivity

## YPR quantities at various fishing mortalities

$$
SBPR = \sum_a E_a N_a w_a
$$

-   $E_a$: some measure of population's fecundity at age

-   the resulting $SBPR$ is going to vary with $F$ because $N_a$ will decline faster when $F$ is greater than zero.

## Beverton-Holt - SRR in terms of $SBPR$

## Beverton-Holt function in terms of steepness

steepness as a function of proportion $p$ of unfished spawning stock size $S_0$ and $\alpha$ and the unexploited spawning biomass per recruit $\Phi_0$

$$
h(p) = \dfrac{R(S= pS_0)}{R(S=S_0)} = p \dfrac{1+\beta S_0}{1_p \beta S_0} = p \dfrac{1 + \beta \Phi_0 R_0}{1 + p \beta \Phi_0 R_0}
$$

## Beverton-Holt function in terms of steepness

To complete the steepness transformation of the SRR, we must define unexploited recruitment and unexploited spawning biomass per recruit

## Ricker function in terms of steepness
steepness as a function of proportion $p$ of unfished spawning stock size $S_0$ and $\alpha$ and the unexploited spawning biomass per recruit $\Phi_0$

## Conversion to compensation ratio

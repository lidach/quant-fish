## Newton-Raphson description
- Newton-Raphson method is an iterative numerical technique used to finding approximate solutions to equations. 

- This is used to solve equations of the form $f(x) = 0$ where $f(x)$ is a real-valued function of a real variable.

- Given an initial guess ($x_0$), the method iteratively refines this guess to get closer and closer to a root of the equation.

## Formula
- The core formula for the Newton-Raphson methods is:
$$
x_{n+1} = x_n-\dfrac{f(x_n)}{(f^\prime x_n)}
$$

where:

- $x_{n+1}$ is the next approximation of the root

- $x_n$ is the current approximation of the root

- $f(x_n)$ is the value of the function at $x_n$

- $f^\prime x_n$ is the derivative (slope) of the function at $x_n$
